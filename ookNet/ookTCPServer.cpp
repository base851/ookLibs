 \class ookTCPServer
 \headerfile ookTCPServer.h "ookLibs/ookNet/ookTCPServer.h"
 \brief Base class for implementing an TCP server. This class simply 
 listens for connections and then hands them off to individual server
 threads which do the actual work.

 The Server and ServerThreads communicate via the Observer/Dispatcher/Handler
 framework found in ookCore. Servers derive from the ookTextMessageHandler class
 and maintain ookMsgDispatcher which is passed to the individual server threads.
 Both the server and server thread register interest in a particualr message type
 with the dispatcher. They also post messages to the dispatcher for handling. In
 this manner both the server and server thread can intercommunicate and only receive
 messages which they are interested in.
