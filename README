=======================================================================================

OVERVIEW
---------
ookLibs is a C++ library of general purpose utility classes. It is designed to provide
a flexible and intuitive framework for creating C++ applications by abstracting some
of the more cumbersome and esoteric tasks to speed the development process.

ookLibs currently provides classes for:

* Application development
* Multithreading
* TCP & SSL Networking, including a delegation event notification framework
* Encryption/Decryption
* File compression/decompression
* File IO
* Connectivity to MySQL and SQLite databases
* XML parsing

Additional functionality may be added in subsequent releases.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
Rather than re-invent what others have already effectively done, ookLibs goal is to 
simplify usage. Thus, ookLibs is primarily a wrapper around other C++ frameworks. As 
such, ookLibs has a number of dependencies in order to be used in a new project:

* Boost (currently using version 0.9.6)
* OpenSSL (currently using version 0.9.8r)
* Crypto++ (currently using version 5.6.1)
* MySQL (currently using version 5.5)
* SQLite (currently using version 3.7.7.1)
